# TermProject
Final project for DS8013


# Required Libraries
To install the required libraries for the project run `pip install .` from the `TERMPROJECT` directory. This will install all dependencies for the models to run.



# Running the Model
The driver to run all the models in the project can be found in `main.py` in the `TERMPROJECT` directory.
To run the models and view the results, run `python main.py` from the `TERMPROJECT` directory.
This will train all the models as well produce the architecture, losses, metric, and RMSE plot for the models. 
It also saves png files of how each models performs on the test dataset.
